<h3>Installation</h3>
<a id='#Installations'></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

For this project, I was interestested in exploring datasets available on Kaggle on US Accidents to gain insights on:

Which state and City in US have the most accidents?

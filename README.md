<h3> 1. Installation</h3>
<a id='#Installations'></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

<h3> 2. Project Motivation</h3>

For this project, I was interestested in exploring datasets available on Kaggle on US Accidents to gain insights on:

Which state and City in US have the most accidents?
What is the impact of Weather conditions on accidents occurrence?
What is the relationship between daily time distribution and Accidents occurrence?  
What time of the day experience the highest accidents occurrence.
